Hey, I'm leaving this to help you get started while I get groceries.

1. The first thing you can do is look over the code in SphereObject3D and CylinderObject3D.
   Using the same general approach, make a Teapot and Torus(donut). The Directx api should provide the necessary calls for that.
   We're required to do this for cubes as well, but I don't know how you want to handle it. I'm leaving that to you since you wrote the cuboid code.
   Finally, most of the othier primitives are broken atm. If you can figure out how to set them up with D3DXMESH and normals, all the better!
2. Look in TestLevel.xml, that's what gets loaded at startup. Note that rapidxml is now a dependency, but I've included it in the repo.
3. I've started on Gouraud shading, and it's mostly done. Since we each need to do one, that leaves you with Phong. The Lighting.fx file contains all that you need.
4. The last major thing that needs doing is UVs/Textures, and it's a doozy. I'm pretty sure we need to write the generation code ourselves, and I
   haven't touched it yet. We should proably start this together, for sure.
5. Camera controls are disabled for the moment, because I've integrated the camera into the scene/made multiple cameras possible.
   If you really need cam controls, then write a method for the Scene class that just returns a pointer to m_ActiveCamera. If not, don't bother,
   since I'll be replacing this stuff soon. I'm planning on seeing if I can implement some super-simple lua integration, which will be much 
   better in the long run. *NOTE* I have done this before, so don't worry about scope. Lua integration is so easy an infant could do it.
6. If all else fails, look for TODO comments, I guess? I don't think there are too many though.
